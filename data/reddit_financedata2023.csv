I'm still there and it's a windfall that might get me about halfway to FIRE alone. Having those years of vested stock I can't touch (private company) has been a powerful form of forced savings.

I bought my house young as a duplex with one half severely distressed. I lived in one half with my wife while we did renovations all ourselves of the other half. This was during early covid. Now we live in the nicer renovated half and rent out the other which covers almost the entire mortgage. We are looking into special zoning incentive programs with the city to build another duplex in our oversized backyard. It'd be a new build to our preference where we'd again rent out half, providing 4 units total, 3 rentals on one lot. Initial estimates show we should roughly break even with the 3 rents and 2 mortgages but seriously increase our living situation. Strategic rental property opportunities plus some luck with picking a good tech company right out of college have been big FIRE accelerants.

My wife is a former refugee and grew up with a humble perspective on a lot of spend, sans travel, travel is our biggest luxury. She stays at home with our 2 young kids as her old degree isn't recognized here. That helps a lot with childcare costs."

Many in the FIRE community are too dogmatic about various aspects like investment choices, lifestyle, expenditures, withdrawal rates and other details. I think many people go too frugal and forget to enjoy life along the way. It's possible to reach FI and enjoy vacations and even (I'll get cruisified for this) the occasional NEW Car.  It's very possible to reach FI without extreme frugality.

RE is not required. It's an option. Many people will get bored or depressed if they retire early. Work friends may drift away. Make sure you have a plan for what you want from life when you do walk away from work life. I'm loving it myself but work can give people a sense of accomplishment and community.

You can start late and still reach financial independence and even retire early if that's your goal. My wife and I had a large negative Net Worth at 32 but still hit our FI number at 55. It's possible. 

I'm not a fan of LeanFIRE. I think many people who RE young do so at far too low an investment base. They fail to project forward and account for various life changes that may occur in the future. 

I strongly believe in the  general FI principles of investing (VTI etc) and the 4% rule as great baseline strategies. Still it is very possible to reach FI through other investment paths. Personally I did mostly dividend stocks. The 4% rule is an awesome rule of thumb. It's not a law. If you invested well a 4% withdrawal rate is unlikely to fail. However it may be possible to draw 6% or more depending upon your investmens, expenses and estate planning desires.",,The amount I originally planned for,,0,800000,1600000,387000,55000,2800,,,2844800,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,74000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,74000,,,,,80000,,80000,
